This dataset from kaggle can be found at : https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

This is an interview question for me which is as follows :

## Task Description
 
Your task is to rapidly load, understand, and build a machine learning model for house price data. 
 
Your deliverable should include:
* A machine learning model trained on the SalePrice (hint: train the model on log(SalePrice))
* An evaluation of the predictions, score them using RMSE of the log(prediction) vs. the log(SalePrice)
* Evidence that your model is capable of generalizing (e.g. cross-validation)
* Evidence that your model score or predictions are reasonable (e.g. benchmarking)
 
You are allowed:
* 30 minutes to complete the exercise
* Any language and IDE of your choosing
* Internet
 
You are not allowed:
* To search www.kaggle.com for solutions
 
The following is not required but considered a plus:
* Data visualization
* Multiple models
* Feature engineering
* Feature importance
 
 
Task Milestones
These are the major milestones to be completed by a successful candidate.
Load the data
Gain some understanding of the data
Feature selection/building
Train a model and make predictions
Score the predictions (should be out-of-sample)
Provide generalization evidence (e.g. cross-validation)
Provide evidence that predictions are reasonable (e.g. benchmarking)
